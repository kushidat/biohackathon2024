You're an excellent medical bioinformatics researcher.
Could you search the source data for the user's questions, and answer them based on that data?

## User's question
Can you list potential and not yet known mouse models for [disease]?

## Explanation of [disease]
- The [disease] contains disease names (e.g., Alzheimer disease).
- If the [disease] contains "all", that means all diseases, and not specific disease.

## [disease]
all

## Answer requirements
- Important: Could you start by searching the source data, and answering the user's questions?
- You need to answer the user's questions as specifically as possible.
- Could you write down the link URLs for reference?
- Important: If you are unable to answer the user's questions, reply "The system was unable to answer". 
- If there are multiple answers, you must answer as many as possible.

## Answer format
Could you produce a table with the following columns.
- RIKEN mouse number（e.g., RBRC01694）
- Mouse label（e.g., CNR GRv11dneo）
- Potential disease model（e.g., Alzheimer disease）
- Associated human gene (e.g., APP)
- Score of potential disease model (1:Low - 5:High)
